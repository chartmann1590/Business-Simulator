<h2 style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333;">Design thinking is a problem-solving approach that involves five stages:</h2>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Empathize**: Understand the customer's needs, pain points, and behaviors.

3. **Prototype**: Create a tangible representation of the solution.
4. **Test**: Evaluate the solution with customers to gather feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-align: justify;">Design thinking is rooted in empathy, creativity, and experimentation. It encourages marketers to think differently about their customers' needs and behaviors, rather than relying on assumptions or traditional marketing methods.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-align: justify;">**Practical Examples and Applications**</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">

</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-align: justify;">**Best Practices**</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
