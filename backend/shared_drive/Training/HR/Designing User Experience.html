<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">User-centered design**: A design approach that prioritizes user needs, goals, and behaviors.
* **Empathy**: Understanding users' motivations, behaviors, and pain points to create solutions that meet their needs.
* **Personas**: Creating fictional characters to represent your target audience's demographics, goals, and behaviors.
* **Wireframing**: Creating low-fidelity sketches of a product or feature to plan its layout and functionality.
* **Prototyping**: Creating interactive mockups of a product or feature to test usability and user feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-align: justify;">**Key Principles**</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333;">Some key principles to keep in mind when designing UX include:</h2>
