4. **Non-Verbal Communication**: Using body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice to convey confidence, enthusiasm, and empathy.

<p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-align: justify;">**Practical Examples and Applications**</p>

2. **In-Person Meetings**: A sales representative meets with a customer face-to-face to discuss a potential sale.
