<h2 style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: #333;">To illustrate these concepts, let's consider a real-world example:</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-align: justify;">Suppose we're launching a new engineering-based product that targets industrial clients. We've identified three potential customer segments: manufacturing companies, equipment suppliers, and research institutions.</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
<li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Customer Segmentation**: We categorize our target customers into:
* Manufacturing companies ( high growth potential)
* Equipment suppliers (stable demand)
* Research institutions (niche market with limited budget)</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-align: justify;">2. **Unique Selling Proposition (USP)**: Our product offers advanced automation capabilities that improve manufacturing efficiency and reduce costs.</p>
